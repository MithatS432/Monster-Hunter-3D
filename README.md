# Monster-Hunter-3D
Kill all the creatures and escape from this cursed place

# What I really want to do
Adjusting the movement parts with Seek algorithm and Pursuit algorithms
Improving the patrolling and chasing part with the Finite State Machine algorithm
Using inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction with OOP
I progressed through 5 different enemies in total
Inheritance-->All monster classes are derived from the EnemyBase class
Polymorphism-->Distances have been adjusted according to their speed, attack and route.
Abstraction-->The die function will be protected, that is, it will be called from derived classes.

# Game Explanation
We're trying to defeat 15 different versions of the same creature in a village. They all have different speeds, damage, and routes

# Controls
w,a,s,d or arrow keys to movement
"space" key to jump
Mouse1 to attack
"F" key to apply super power
